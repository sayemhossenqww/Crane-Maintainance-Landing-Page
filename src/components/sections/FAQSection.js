      question: "How long does it take to implement the system?",
      answer: "Implementation time varies based on the size of your organization and the number of assets. For a standard implementation, we typically complete setup, data migration, and training within 4 months. Our enterprise implementation includes a detailed project plan with milestones to ensure a smooth transition to the new system."
    },
    {
      question: "Can we import our existing maintenance records?",
      answer: "Yes, our system includes data migration tools that support importing existing records from Excel, CSV files, or other maintenance management systems. During implementation, our team will work with you to map your data to our system and ensure a complete transfer of your historical maintenance and inspection records."
    },
    {
      question: "Is the system compliant with industry regulations?",
      answer: "Our system is designed to meet regulatory requirements for crane inspections and maintenance across multiple jurisdictions. The digital inspection forms and scheduling tools are configured to comply with OSHA, ASME, and other relevant standards. The system maintains comprehensive records with audit trails for regulatory compliance and provides built-in reporting for certification and inspection documentation."
    },
    {
      question: "Does the system work on mobile devices?",
      answer: "Yes, our system is fully responsive and optimized for use on tablets and smartphones. Field technicians can complete inspections, update work orders, and access documentation from their mobile devices. The system also supports offline functionality, allowing work to continue even in areas with limited connectivity, with automatic synchronization when connection is restored."
    },
    {
      question: "What kind of support is included?",
      answer: "All plans include email support during business hours, access to our extensive knowledge base, and regular system updates. Professional and Enterprise plans include priority support with faster response times, phone support, and a dedicated account manager. Our Enterprise customers receive 24/7 emergency support, custom development services, and on-site technical visits as needed."
